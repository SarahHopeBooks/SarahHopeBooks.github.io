## Chapter 1
"Look, I recognize that guy!" Jenny Davidson exclaimed.
"Oh, who is it?" Her best friend Abby Johnson asked.
"That's my boyfriend Frank!" Jenny replied. She hadn't seen Frank in a few years, since she moved to Montana.
"Did he ride all the way from Georgia?" Abby asked.
"I don't know, I haven't seen him in years!" Jenny said. "He never told me his phone number, maybe he doesn't even have a phone, or maybe he just doesn't want to talk to me."
Jenny lived on a ranch out in the country. They jumped onto horses themselves, and galloped after Frank.
They shouted his name, but he didn't respond. He galloped on without even taking notice to the two girls who were galloping after him.
"I know a shortcut!" Jenny shouted. "We can cut him off, I know where he's going!"
"Sounds good!" Abby replied. "We'll catch up to him!"
Presently Jenny turned off onto a windy overpass where they could watch Frank while they galloped along. Gradually they left him behind.
They exited the overpass and waited for him. Soon, in the distance, they saw him. A lone figure, riding along, straight towards them.
The sun sat in the middle of the sky.
"Time for lunch, Jenny!" Abby said. "He should be passing us in about an hour."
Both girls had gotten permission from their mothers to go on a horse ride, and have a picnic.
This was not unusual for them, as they loved the great outdoors.
Abby opened the picnic basket and took out the fixings for lunch.
"Our horses are faster than his, so even if he doesn't stop, we can overtake him." Abby said. "Let's enjoy this lunch while we wait."
"That's a good idea Abby." Jenny said, as she awoke from the daydream she was having.
"I'm just worried he's not going to like me anymore, Abby." Jenny said. "It seems like if he really cared about me he would have stopped when he saw us."
"Oh, he probably just didn't see us." Abby said. "Let's not worry about it now. We can worry later."
"That's right." Jenny said. "I suppose even if he had given me his number, I wouldn't be in contact with him much. There isn't any coverage out here in the country, which I like." She smiled.
"Yeah, it's a lot more fun to be here and enjoy the outdoors instead of always being inside and watching YouTube videos." Abby agreed. "It's more like a novelty to see a video this way."
"And it's so much fun to be homeschooled instead of having to go to public school." Jenny said. "I just love it here." She smiled, as she ate her lunch.
"Me too." Abby replied. "It's so peaceful here."
"I'm so glad you moved here with us." Jenny said. "It would be so lonely without you."
"Frank should be pretty close now." Abby said, sticking her head out from behind the trees. "What! He's gone!"
"Let's go!" Jenny said. "We might still be able to find him."
The girls had already finished lunch, so they threw the garbage in a bag, and began the chase.
"I hope we can find him!" Jenny said. "We should have kept a better watch for him, so we could see what direction he went."
"Yeah, but he shouldn't be too hard to find." Abby said. "He probably turned in to a ranch, and there isn't many here."
"That's true." Jenny said. "But he could have gone to town, too."
The horses galloped down the dirt trail, but no matter how far they went, Frank did not come into view.
"I guess I have to be going home, Abby." Jenny said. "The sun is starting to set."
"I should probably be going home too." Abby said. "I'll stop by your ranch first though."
Soon they were back at the ranch.
"I don't recognize that horse, Abby!" Jenny said, pointing to a dark chestnut horse.
"Me either!" Abby replied. "Maybe your folks have a visitor."
"Let's go see!" Jenny said.
They peeked through the living room window.
Jenny gasped. "Abby, it's Frank!" She said. "We were out looking for him, and he's back here at the ranch!"
"Oh, that's hilarious!" Abby said, bursting into laughter. "See you tomorrow!"
"See you tomorrow!" Jenny said, entering the house.
"Hello Jenny!" Hannah, her mother said. "How was your horse ride?"
"Oh it was great!" Jenny replied. "Abby and I had such a fun time. Thanks for making us lunch!"
"That's awesome Jenny!" Hannah said.
They walked into the living room, where Frank was sitting.
"Hello Jenny!" William, her father said. "This is Frank."
"Hi Frank." Jenny said. "I haven't seen you in so long!"
"I didn't know you lived here." Frank said, shyly. "It's nice to see you though!"
"Why are you all the way down here in Montana?" Jenny asked.
"I'm out here in this area to find a good spot for a new town." Frank said. "I don't know where it will be yet, but I've been offered a lot of money to find a good settlement for a new town. As big as New York City!"
"What?" Jenny asked, stunned by the news. "You want to put a new city in here? A giant one?"
"Yeah." Frank said. "You don't like that idea?"
"I like the big open prairie with only small towns, and no highway noise." Jenny said, sad that Frank didn't. "You would too if you tried living in this sort of place."
"I don't know..." Frank said, hesitantly. "I'm more of a big city person. There's no internet to play my favorite video games..."
"Yes, but it's way more fun to be out in the open, riding horses." Jenny said. "Just try it. If you don't like it, you don't like it. But please don't build a big city with loud highways."
"Well, okay." Frank said. "But where else could I build a big city?"
"Maybe Georgia." Jenny said. "That's a good spot."
"Yes, but it already has a million." Frank said.
"I'm sure you're find somewhere other than Montana." Jenny said. "Or you could just forget about building a city and settle down."
"Dinner's ready!" Hannah said, coming into the room.
Later that evening, after Frank had gone to bed, Hannah pulled Jenny aside. "What were you two taking about?" She asked.
"What he was doing in Montana." Jenny said. "He wants to put in a big city, as big as New York City, and put a million highways in, all over the state.  He wants to remove all the ranches."
"Why would he want that?" Hannah asked. "That's the best part of Montana, quiet, peaceful times. I can't believe it."
"Me either." Jenny said, with a sad look on her face.
"You seemed to know him." Hannah continued. "How? When?"
"He was my boyfriend when we lived in Georgia." Jenny said. "I don't know, though now. He's so into big cities, and I'm not."
"Oh, I remember that now!" Hannah said. "He's so nice though. Maybe you could convince him to not be so much into big cities. Once he's here long enough he'll envy us, living here. He'll be here a while because he needs somewhere to stay."
"Okay mom. I'll try. But I still don't know about him." Jenny replied. "I've got to go to bed now. Goodnight!"
"Goodnight Jenny." Hannah replied.
Jenny went to her room, still wondering if he was the right guy for her or not.

The next morning she awoke to her alarm clock. She had to do some chores.
She yawned and pulled her clothes on. Frank being here stressed her out.
She shook it off and went downstairs to get some breakfast.
Frank was downstairs eating some breakfast himself.
"Hello Frank." Jenny said.
"Hello Jenny." Frank replied.
Jenny sighed. She opened the door and stepped outside.
Abby was in the barn waiting for her.
"Hello Jenny!" She called from the barn. "Did you figure out why Frank is here?"
"Yes." Jenny replied. "He's looking for a place to build a big city. I told him to try somewhere else. We'll see what he does."
"Oh that's sad." Abby said. "Is he still your boyfriend?"
"For the moment." Jenny replied. "But only if he stops wanting to live on the big city."
"I'm going to do my chores quick, then maybe we can go on another horse back ride." Jenny continued. "Then we can be sure Frank isn't eavesdropping on us."
"Good idea." Abby said. "I'll help you with them."
Soon they had all the chores done.
"Let's go now, Abby!" Jenny said. "It'll be so much fun!"
They got on their horses and galloped off.
"I'm just sad that Frank wants to build a big city." Jenny said. "I'm really hoping that him staying here will make him not want to build a big city, and then we can get back together."
"I can see that." Abby said. "But we won't know until later. Let's just have a fun time together."
"Okay." Jenny said. "We don't need to worry about Frank. I just thought he was the perfect guy for me, but he wasn't so into big cities back then."
"Yeah, he was very nice when we lived in Georgia." Abby said. "But he doesn't really any more. He used to like horses, but now it's all about the big city."
"Maybe I'll meet a real cowboy, one who likes horses and the country, instead of big cities." Jenny said. "Frank pretended to like horses, but he didn't."
"That would be fun." Abby said. "Maybe I'll meet one too."
"I still like Frank, though." Jenny said. "But not if the only goal in his life is money and big cities."
"Say, do you want to ride into town?" Abby asked. "My mom needs some flour."
"Sure!" Jenny said. "I haven't been into town in a while. I might be able to get a new book. I've been saving up for a while."
They entered town.
"Oh no!" Abby exclaimed. "The grocery store is closed! I guess we'll have to either ride the 30 miles to the next town or ride the 10 back."
"Does your mom need it right now?" Jenny asked. "If she doesn't, then we can come back tomorrow, but if she does, then let's ride to the next town."
"She needs it today." Abby said. "So let's go to the next town!"
"Sounds good." Jenny said. "Let's go!"
"Did you bring your money, Jenny?" Abby asked. "We might be able to get some Christmas presents while we're out."
"Yes, I actually did." Jenny replied. "Normally I don't but I did this time."
"Great!" Abby said. "This will be so much fun! I wonder what they have there. We haven't been there in a long time."
"That's true." Jenny said. "Maybe they will have some of those horse treats."
"We don't normally give the horses birthday presents." Abby said, with a wink. "But if you want to you can!
"You're ridiculous, Abby!" Jenny said. "How do you come up with such funny jokes?"
"I don't know." Abby said. "I guess it just comes naturally."
"I wish I could make such funny jokes." Jenny said. "But oh well."

They arrived in town.
"Okay, we need to go to the grocery store to get the flour, then we can look at the other stores."
"Sounds good!" Jenny said. "I haven't been to this town in a long time."
In the grocery store they were greeted by a pleasant young man.
He was wearing jeans, a shirt, cowboy boots, and a hat.
"Good Morning. Is there anything I can get you?" He asked.
"Yes, we're looking for 2 bags of brown rice flour." Abby replied.
"Oh. Sorry, but we're out of stock." The man replied. "I could order some in for you."
"It's fine. We just rode 40 miles to get here." Abby said. "We can try the store in town tomorrow. It was just closed today."
"Okay. Have a nice day!" The man said as they walked out the door.

"We can go and look for Christmas presents at least." Abby said. "Otherwise it would be a big waste to have come here."
"Okay." Jenny said. "Let's go to the Christmas warehouse first."
They went into the store.
"Good morning." The girl who worked at the desk said.
"Good morning." Jenny replied.
"Do you se/ll Christmas presents here?" Abby asked.
"Yes, that's the only thing we sell here." The girl said.
"Great!" Jenny said. "Let's go look around!"
"Oh, I love that little Christmas tree!" Abby said, pointing to a cluster of Christmas trees. "I wonder how much it costs."
She bent down to look at it.
"It's only 3 dollars!" She exclaimed.
"You should get it then." Jenny said. "You can put it on your bedroom."
"Great idea!" Abby replied. She grabbed the tree and put it in her cart.
"The prices are so cheap here!" Jenny said. "But we can't get much, we have to take it back on the horses."
"That's right." Abby said. "I didn't think about that."
"We'll have to come back." Jenny said. "This is so much fun!"
"It is!" Abby said. "But we have to get going if we want to get home for lunch."
The girls checked out and loaded their stuff onto the horses, and headed back home.
"That store was so much fun!" Jenny said. "And it didn't take us that long to ride here!"
"I know!" Abby said. "Our horses are really fast!"
"But they can't be that fast." Jenny said. "No horse can run at 60 miles an hour. We must just enjoy the ride."
"That's probably true." Abby said. "We're probably going at around 20 miles an hour, so that would be 2 hours."
"Sounds about right." Jenny said. "We must enjoy the ride, which makes it feel shorter."
"Yeah, we love riding horses!" Abby said. "So it's just natural that we like the ride, and it feels shorter."
"Hopefully our moms aren't worried about us." Jenny said. "We've been gone for a long time."
"Yeah, but we're gone for a while a lot." Abby said. "They know we love the outdoors. But we're going to have to be getting home soon, it's almost lunch time!"
"I can't wait to eat lunch!" Jenny said. "But we're already going as fast as we can. We'll just have to hope we'll get there for lunch. If we don't, I'm sure there's leftovers."
They entered the town that was 10 miles from their house.
"The grocery store is open!" Abby exclaimed. "We might as well go in."
"Okay." Jenny said. "We should have plenty of time. We went faster than usual."
The owner, John Brown, greeted them.
"Good Morning!" He said. "What are you looking for today?"
"I'm looking for some flour for my mother." Abby said. "Is it in stock?"
"Yes it is." John said. "I'll get some for you. How many bags?"
"2." Abby replied.
"I'll be right back." John said. He went into the back of the store and got the flour.
"I'll just charge it to your parents." He said.
"Sounds good." Abby said, picking up the flour. "See you later!"
They went back out to the horses and loaded the flour on them.
"Now I feel better." Abby said. "My mom wanted this for some apple pies. Maybe when she makes it you could come over!"
"That would be fun!" Jenny replied. "I love apple pie!"
"And we could invite our friends and have a dance party." Abby said. "And then eat twice baked potatoes, creamed corn, and candied sweet potatoes!"
"Yum! We'll have to do that." Jenny said. "It would be so much fun."

The Johnsons had a big ranch, with a few barns.
Three of the barns were for parties.
The first was a spot to put horses, the second was barn was a big barn with a big kitchen and a big dining room, and the third one was a big living room.
And of course they had a house too. It was big and luxurious too.

"Maybe we could do a sleep over." Jenny said.
"That would be fun." Abby agreed. "I'll see if mom agrees."
"I hope she does!" Jenny said. "It would be so much fun!"
"I agree." Abby said. "Here's my ranch!"
She turned into her long driveway.
"See you after lunch!" She called, as she turned in.
"You too!" Jenny replied.
A little bit later she entered her parent's ranch.
The smell of mashed potatoes, asparagus, roast, and gravy wafted through the air.
Jenny stabled her horse and went into the house.
Hannah was just putting the food on the table.
"Had a good ride?" Hannah asked her.
"Yes, we did." Jenny replied. "We got some flour for Abby's mom in town."
"That's good." Hannah said. "Sit down, I'll call the rest."
Soon they were all sitting at the table enjoying the meal Hannah had prepared.
"This is really good, Mrs. Davidson!" Frank said.
"Thanks Frank." Hannah replied. "You can call me Hannah."
"So, did you decide where that city was going?" William asked.
"I decided on Northwest Washington." Frank replied.
"So you'll be leaving soon?" William asked.
"Yes, in the next few days." Frank replied.
"I hope it works for you!" William said. "I tried to do that once, but I couldn't decide on a good location."
"In didn't know that!" Frank said. "That's very interesting."
"I never settled on a location because I just loved it here in Montana." William said. "It was so much more fun to ride horses then build buildings."
"I don't like riding horses at all." Frank said. "Driving a car is much more fun to me. You can get places a lot faster in a car."
"Yes, but you can enjoy your ride on a horse." William said. "It feels like it's that fast because you enjoy it."
"Well I don't enjoy it." Frank said. "Someday I'm going to be a race car driver."

"So, anything new, Jenny?" Hannah asked.
"Abby might have a party with a sleepover sometime." Jenny replied. "But she has to see if her mom wants to do it."
"That would be fun!" Hannah said. "They have such grand parties at their ranch."

A few days later, Frank was getting ready to leave.
Jenny didn't know what to think. She wanted to not want him to go, but the way he was right now, it wasn't possible. She was a country girl, and he was a city boy.
"Bye Frank." She said, trying to act like she cared for him.
"Goodbye Jenny." He said. Jenny could tell from his expression that he didn't have any feelings for her, either.
Frank opened the door and got on his horse. He waved goodbye and galloped off into the dust.

A few minutes later Abby opened the door.
"Mom says the party is on!" She said. "It will be so much fun!"
"Let's go invite our friends!" Jenny said. "The party will be so much fun!"
"Yes, let's go!" Abby said. They went outside and got on their horses.
"Let's invite the Jimms." Abby said. "And the Robbs."
The Jimms were a family of 4, and the kids were both girls, Maria and Annie.
The Robbs were only a family of 3, and the only kid was a boy, and his name was Robert. He was Abby's boyfriend.
"Let's invite the Simpsons too." Jenny said.
The Simpsons were a family of 10, the parents, and 8 girls.
"The closest are the Simpsons." Abby said. "So let's start with the Jimms. They're the furthest away."
"Okay." Jenny said. "This party will be so much fun!"

An hour later they were standing on the Jimms's front steps.
Jenny knocked on the door.
Maria answered it. "Hello!" She said. "Come in!"
Jenny and Abby went inside.
"We came over to ask if you wanted to come to a party tomorrow at my house." Abby said. "It will so much fun. And if you wanted we could have a sleepover!"
"That would be so much fun." Maria said. "But you know my mom doesn't let me ride alone."
"That's okay, everyone can come!" Abby said. "It's on Saturday at 10!"
"Oh that would be so much fun!" Maria said. "I'll ask my mom if we can go."
Maria got up and went to ask her mom.
Maria was had just turned 13. There was a big age gap between her and Abby and Jenny, because Abby and Jenny were 18.
But despite the age gap, they were best friends.
Annie was 12, a year younger than Maria.
Presently Maria came back.
"My mom says she can't come, because there's too much to do." Maria said. "However, she said that if I could ride home with you today, than I could go. She said Annie could come too."
"Sure, we can do that!" Abby said. "There's still a few more houses we wanted to stop by to invite more of our friends. Do you have any you want to invite?"
"No." Maria replied. "The only ones I have besides you are the Robbs, but I'm guessing you're already inviting them."
"Yep." Abby said. "We're planning on stopping by their house."
"I'm going to go get ready." Maria said. "Make yourselves comfortable."
Maria left the room.
"I hope my mom says she can stay overnight." Abby said. "Otherwise I hope yours does!"
"I didn't think about that." Jenny said. "If they don't, what will we do?
"We'll just say we'll all sleep outside, unless Maria can sleep inside." Abby said. "But I really doubt that my mom wouldn't be okay with it."
"I guess we'll see!" Jenny said. "Won't it be fun if we have to sleep outside?"
"That would be hilarious." Abby said. "But we would never be able to tell Maria's mom."
Just then Maria came down the stairs, followed closely by Annie.
"We're going to a party?" Annie asked. "I haven't been to a party in a long time!"
"Yes, we're having a party." Abby said. "At my house."
"Your house?" Annie asked. "Your house is so much fun!"
"Yep." Abby said. "Let's go outside and get going. Got everything you need for two nights?"
"Yes!" Maria and Annie replied in unison.
"Well then, let's go!" They went outside, and got on the horses.
"We have to stop by some other houses on the way there." Jenny said. "But it will be so much fun."
"I know you guys haven't been on a horse ride this long without riding on a horse with someone else, but I'm sure you'll find it very fun." Abby said.
"I hope it's fun!" Annie said. "Even if it isn't the party will be!"

An hour later they were standing on the front porch of the Robbs's house.
Abby knocked. Robert opened the door.
"Hello Abby!" He said. "What brings you here?"
"We came to see if you wanted to go to a party with us." Abby said. "It's going to be at my house."
"Your house?" Robert said. "Of course I want to come."
"Great!" Abby said. "Feel free to invite anyone you want. The party is at ten tommorow."
"Sounds fun!" He replied. "I'll be there!"
With that, they were back on the trail again.
"Just the Simpsons left!" Abby said. "This will be so much fun!"
"It will!" Maria said. "What's for dinner?"
"I don't know." Abby said. "I wasn't expecting you to come home with us tonight, so I didn't ask. I guess we'll see when we get there!"

Soon they were at the Simpsons's house.
Lily, the mom, answered the door.
"Come on in!" She said. "I'll tell the girls you're here."
She lead them to the living room, and headed upstairs.
They settled into the couches.
"I hope they can come." Maria said. "They're some of my best friends."
"Mine too." They all agreed.
Lily came back down the stairs.
"They're coming." She said. "I'll make you all a snack while you wait."
"Thank you!" Abby said.
"You're welcome." Lily replied, as she walked into the kitchen.
The Simpson girls came down the stairs.
"I haven't seen you guys in a while!" Heidi, the oldest of them said. "What brings you here?"
"We were wondering if you wanted to come to a party." Abby said. "It's at my house."
"Of course we do!" Heidi said. "Let's have a snack before you go."
Just then Lily came in with a platter of sandwiches, a pitcher of hot cocoa, and cookies.
"What brings you here today?" She asked, as she handed a sandwich, and a mug of hot cocoa to each girl.
"Abby is going to have a party at her house." Heidi spoke up. "We can go, right?"
"Of course, dear." Lily replied. "Enjoy your snack!"
She left the room.
"What are you going to have to eat at the party?" Anna, the youngest, who was 13 asked.
"Oh, we're going to have mashed potatoes, creamed corn, twice baked potatoes, cranberry sauce,candied sweet potatoes, and creamed corn." Abby replied.
"That sounds so yummy!" Anna said. "I can't wait!"
"It sure will be." Abby said. "The best part is either the twiced baked potatoes, the creamed corn, or the candied sweet potatoes."
"Do you want to play a game before you leave?" Sarah, who was 16, asked. "We have some fun ones like The Settlers of Catan."
"Of course!" Jenny replied. "I haven't played The Settlers of Catan in so long!"
"Sounds good, I'll go get it!" Sarah replied, getting up from the couch and running into another room.
A moment later Sarah returned with a the game in her hands.
"I'll be the banker!" Mary shouted.
"I'll be the player!" Jenny shouted. They all roared with laughter.
"That's a good one!" Heidi said, still laughing.
"Okay, let's play!" Abby said. "I'll help set it up!"
An hour later, Abby stood up.
"I guess we've got to get going." She said. "It's almost lunch time."
"Thanks for playing with us!" Anna said. "See you at the party!"
Abby, Jenny, Maria, and Annie got on their horses and galloped off.
"We're only a mile from our houses." Abby said. "We should reach home in plenty of time."
Suddenly, a dark cloud started to come up.
"Hey Abby! Look at that cloud!" Jenny said. "It looks like a storm is coming in!"
"Looks like a snow storm!" Abby said. "The first one of the season. We better get back fast!"
"In November?" Jenny said. "I sure hope we can still have the party."
"Oh, we will." Abby replied. "If we need, we can get a big sleigh and go pick everyone up!"
They reached Jenny's house. "See you tomorrow!" Jenny said.
Jenny waved as Abby galloped away with Annie. Then she stabled her horse and went inside.
"I'm glad you got back before that snowstorm!" Hannah said. "I was worried about you."
"Me too!" Jenny said. "It looks like it's going to be a big one."
Already it was beginning to snow.
"How much do you think its going to snow?" Jenny asked.
"Probably around 3-6 feet." William said, coming into the room. "I don't think it's going to melt until February."
"That's a lot of snow!" Hannah said. "Do you think you'll be able to make it to the party tommorow, Jenny?"
"I hope so!" Jenny said. "David is a strong horse. I'm sure I'll make it!"

The next morning Jenny got up early. She was going over to Abby's house to help set up the party.
The snow had stopped. She looked out the window. The snow was halfway up it, around 7 feet.
She got dressed and ate some breakfast.
Then she bundled up and opened the front door.
A gust of cold wind met her. "Brrrr" She shivered.
She went back into the house and grabbed a shovel. She would need it if she wanted to get to the barn.
She opened the door once again, and went outside, shutting it behind her.
There was a just enough space outside under the cover of the porch cover for her to stand.
"I don't know if I'm going to make it in time." She thought to herself.
She took her shovel and shoveled out steps to the top.
She stepped on the snow. It was hard packed.
"Perfect." She said to herself. She walked to the top of the stairs and across snow to the barn.
She could barely see it. Only the roof was showing.
"I hope the horses are okay." She said aloud. The horses seemed to hear her, as they responded with a neigh.
She dug out a ramp to the door, so the David could walk out.
At the ground level she dug a bigger area so the doors would open.
The warmth of the barn welcomed her as she opened the door.
She quickly went in and closed the door. Then she got David ready, and she got on him. Then she rode him outside.
She rode swiftly over to Abby's house.
She knocked on the door. Abby opened the door.
"Come in!" Abby said. "Maria and Annie are already helping. Between the four of us, we should have this party running in no time!"
"If you already have enough help, I can shovel outside, so our guests can get to the barns." Jenny said.
"Good idea!" Abby said. "We haven't gotten out to the barns yet, we've just been working on getting the stuff ready to bring out."
"Sounds good." Jenny said. "I'll go get busy then."
Jenny went outside and shoveled out access to the stable barn. Since they were all connected, she only had to do that one.
Soon the barns were decorated and ready.
At 9 they were all done.
"Let's go have a snack." Abby suggested. "Lunch is at 12, so we won't be full at lunch time."
"Okay!" Maria replied. "But we have to wait till 12 to eat the delicious food?"
"Yes." Abby replied. "But we'll have plenty of fun in the first two hours of the party!"

After eating a snack the girls went out to the barns to wait for the others to arrive. They sat down on the couch and waited. Abby's mom came into the barn to start cooking.
"I saw some of your friends coming." She said. "I think they're about a mile away. You better go and greet them!"
"Okay!" They chorused.
They got on their snowsuits and went outside.
Abby peered into the distance. "I can see the Simpsons. And I think I can see Robert and his friends too."
